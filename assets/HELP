 =============== DESCRIPTION ===============
 <br><br>
 <font color="red">=> How does it work? </font><br>
 Limbo is a software emulator for Android devices. Currently it emulates 
 Inter 32bit and 64bit architectures for a variety of CPUs and peripheral devices.
 Emulation speed varies depending on your Android device. For a list of compatible OSes 
 and instructions visit the Limbo wiki:

 <br><br>
 <font color="red">=> Recommended </font><br>
 To fully take advantage of Limbo you'll need to install a QWERTY keyboard for your Android device:
 like the popular Hacker's keyboard:<br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard">
