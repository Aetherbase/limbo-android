4. Build

    a. To build the app make sure you're under the root directory:
        $> cd /home/youraccount/.../limbo-android

    b. Build the static and shared libraries (libqemu-img.so & 
       libqemu-system-i386.so):
        
        Change directory to ./jni and type:
        make release-arm

        make release-x86
        
    c. Build the Android APK (Limbo.apk) from Eclipse or Netbeans.
    		 
    	** Make sure the *.so libraries are zipped in the final .apk
    	(Eclipse should do that automatically) 
    	
    d. If you want to build the ARM Emulator update qemu.config.mak file:
    TARGET_LIST = arm-softmmu
