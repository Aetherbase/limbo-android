================================================================================

1. What is Limbo?

Limbo is a QEMU-based emulator for Android. It currently supports PC emulation 
of Intel ix86 architectures.
For more information visit:
https://code.google.com/p/limbo-android/
    

===============================================================================

2. Requirements:

    Android SDK
    Android NDK r8
    Eclipse + Eclipse Android plugin or Netbeans + Android plugin
    An Android device (most stock/custom roms should be compatible)

===============================================================================

3. Known Issues:
	See https://code.google.com/p/limbo-android/issues/list
	
===============================================================================
3. Setup

    Configure variables for toolchain and NDK directories for your device
     in files: android-toolchain.mak and android-device-config/*.mak
     
    Caveats (ugly fixes): 
    1. If you're having compile errors in memory.h comment temporarily the //#include "memory.h" 
    line in android NDK header stdlib.h.
    2. If you're having errors during run time about LOGD_TMR and other logging 
    functions you'll want to add temporarily '#include "logutils.h"' at the end 
    of stdio.h in android NDK and recompile.

===============================================================================
4. Build

    a. To build the app make sure you're under the root directory:
        $> cd /home/youraccount/.../limbo-android

    b. Build the static and shared libraries (libqemu-img.so & 
       libqemu-system-i386.so):
        ./configure
        make
        
    c. Build the Android APK (Limbo.apk) from Eclipse or Netbeans.
    		 
    	** Make sure the *.so libraries are zipped in the final .apk
    	(Eclipse should do that automatically) 

===============================================================================
5. Run
	a. Recommend installing a full Qwerty keyboard for Android (ie Hacker's keyboard 
		from the Google Android store) 
	b. Start the Limbo app and choose CPU, Memory (~8-64MB),etc..
	c. Choose a bootable disk image(s) for CDRom, Floppy, and a HDD image
	d. Start the virtual machine.
    e. Have fun
